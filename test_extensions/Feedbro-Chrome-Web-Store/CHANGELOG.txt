  - Bugfix: linkify was broken at least for Twitter

4.15.0 - 2023-02-09
  - Bugfix: eBay parser didn't work correctly if user was using localized domain like ebay.it - URLs are now autoconverted by Feedbro
      before scanning (originally provided URL is still preserved in feed settings). Use "Advanced Search" on eBay to limit results from
      certain locations if needed.
  - Bugfix: Fixed eBay parser (was broken due to structural change on eBay) 
  - Bugfix: Fixed VK parser (was broken due to VK structural changes + relative date parsing improved)
  - Enhancement: Medium feeds are now found with "Find Feeds in Current Tab"

  - Bugfix: enhanced input data sanitization

  - Bugfix: fix to the new Instagram parser - the first version didn't include latest posts. Thanks to Britney Spears!

4.12.5 - 2022-06-03
  - Bugfix: Instagram integration broke on 2022-06-02 because Instagram changed their APIs - fixed
       Note that hashtag searches work only when logged on and Instagram very quickly starts to force login so in
       practice you need to be logged on to Instagram at all times.	   
  - Bugfix: eBay has retired the hidden RSS endpoint - restored Feedbro's eBay parser into use

4.12.4 - 2022-04-16
  - Enhancement: looks like eBay RSS feeds are still available in a different URL - Feedbro's parser now just directs the search URL to the actual eBay RSS feed and 
      doesn't parse the HTML page anymore
  - Enhancement: feed parser now includes names of all authors (if there are multiple author, dc:creator tags)

  - Bugfix: VK plugin had a date parsing bug which occurred with posts timestamped to "yesterday" with "pm" time.

4.11.12 - 2022-03-10
  - Bugfix: Twitter parser failed if tweet timeline contained posts that Twitter considers "age restricted". Such tweets are not
      visible without logging in and since parsing is based on public data (without logon), age restricted posts are now skipped.

4.11.11 - 2022-02-18
  - Enhancement: automatically map mobile.twitter.com to twitter.com

  - Enhancement: pinned Tweets are now also included in the Twitter user profile scan
  - Enhancement: dark mode is now also active in the Feedbro WebExtension popup  
  - Bugfix: Twitter parser choked with tweets that had "Stay Informed" box below them (and different data structure)

  - Bugfix: Twitter parser didn't handle properly timelines with deleted tweets still visible as "tombstones"

4.11.4 - 2022-01-26

  - Enhancement: Improved Instagram profile page automatic feed naming (to drop post counts etc noise)

4.11.0 - 2022-01-05
  - Feature: Instagram hashtag feeds are now supported (e.g. https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/blonde/)
  - Feature: YouTube channel subscriptions JSON file can be now directly imported with "Import Feed Subscriptions (OPML)" button
      on Feedbro's options page. There's no need to convert the file from JSON to OPML manually. You can get your YouTube
      subscriptions as JSON using Google's Takeout service: https://takeout.google.com/u/1/takeout/custom/youtube
      YouTube subscriptions will be added to "YouTube" folder in Feedbro.	  
  - Bugfix: Fixed Instagram username and hashtag link generation
  - Enhancement: removed donate-link because so few people ever donated anything - thanks to everyone who did!

4.10.0 - 2021-08-31

  - Enhancement: build process related enhancement related to AMO reviews - no impact on functionality

  - Enhancement: share URLs changed to use HTTPS protocol
  - Enhancement: Rules export now indents the JSON file properly
  - Enhancement: Instagram parser should now parse profile pages reliably without forced login prompt problems + images should show up always without expiring.
      The downside is that non-public profile pages aren't visible anymore and Instagram posts don't get proper dates (article date in Feedbro is the scan date).  
  - Enhancement: StumbleUpon removed from "Send To" menu
  - Feature: Telegram added to "Send To" menu  

4.9.9 - 2021-04-12
  - Bugfix: when adding a feed via the feed dialog, the feed initial load didn't comply e.g. with the "Maximum entries to save" although
      that value was respected in subsequent loads.  

4.9.8 - 2021-04-07
  - Bugfix: Facebook public pages didn't load if user was logged on the Facebook because Facebook renders pages differently depending on
      whether you are logged on or not
  - Bugfix: HTTP code 401 returned by a feed was incorrectly shown as "No network" status
  - Enhancement: Facebook parser now properly detects if the user is prompted for login and returns 401 code (Facebook starts
      to force logging on if it knows based on your IP address that you have a Facebook account or it detects multiple page requests
      for several URLs within short time frame. This info expires after a while). If you monitor multiple Facebook pages with Feedbro,
      you either have to be logged on to Facebook or use a high value for scanning interval to keep scans infrequent.

4.9.7 - 2021-04-02
  - Enhancement: Twitter plugin now supports animated GIFs
  - Enhancement: Reddit parsing now supports non-standard atom:pubDate
  - Bugfix: Facebook group parsing had stopped working due to Facebook API change

  - Enhancement: MathJax no longer requires "eval" permission in manifest.json

4.9.5 - 2021-02-18
  - Bugfix: Twitter parsing crashed the feed parser if the Twitter account was suspended. It also killed the parsing thread.

4.9.4 - 2021-01-23
  - Bugfix: tiny edit to readtrigger element placing

4.9.3 - 2021-01-23
  - Bugfix: automatic "mark as read" mode 1 was broken in view mode 5 due to recent changes

4.9.2 - 2021-01-18
  - Enhancement: modification to Mathjax loader to ensure it can't run on Firefox

4.9.0 - 2021-01-16

  - Enhancement: enclosures are now hidden in view mode 6 to avoid layout bleeding  

4.8.0 - 2021-01-08
  - Feature: Rumble support! See rumble.com - a bit like YouTube. Navigate to channel home page and use "Find Feeds in Current Tab". e.g. https://rumble.com/c/FortniteGame
  - Enhancement: entries in OPML that have type "atom" are now also imported (although the OPML spec doesn't define such attribute value) - e.g. Liferea uses this  
  - Bugfix: Vimeo feed support was broken - fixed embedded videos and incorrect enclosures - unfortunately the feed does not have proper titles for entries or the feed itself in the RSS XML
  - Bugfix: if media:content does not have "url" parameter, it won't be included as an enclosure

4.7.2 - 2020-10-16
  - Bugfix: Sepia theme had a white title text in viewmode 3 for the active item if "mark read" mode was set to "manual"

4.7.1 - 2020-10-11
  - Bugfix: YouTube search feed was temporarily broken due to YouTube bug workaround fix introduced in 4.6.1 - fixed

  - Feature: Slack support - you can now use Rules to post matching feed entry title & link directly to a Slack channel using Slack Webhooks
  - Feature: Discord support - you can now use Rules to post matching feed entry title & link directly to a Discord channel using Discord Webhooks
  - Enhancement: tag names in Tags view are now underlined and cursor is changed to pointer
  - Enhancement: Notification timeout setting removed from Feedbro Options because that can't be really controlled by the extension  
  - Bugfix: fixed locale related buttons in Feedbro Options not to reload the page

4.6.3 - 2020-09-15
  - Bugfix: notification timeout functionality disabled because it deleted notifications on Chrome that had not been shown yet if there were
      many notifications pending in the "show next queue"

4.6.2 - 2020-09-12
  - Enhancement: Facebook parser should now work for public pages like /BMW and groups with both the old and new UI

4.6.1 - 2020-09-10
  - Bugfix: feeds that contained a mix of entries with content and no content got duplicated content for entries with no content. Fixed.
  - Workaround: YouTube seems to have a bug that sometimes generates feed XML entries without published-tag - this caused Feedbro to use current date for the entries.
      Now if such invalid XML entries are found, they are skipped (until YouTube sends them with the published date).  

4.6.0 - 2020-08-24
  - Feature: Telegram support - Feedbro can now parse Telegram URLs like https://t.me/s/netflix
  - Bugfix: Popup "Open Explorer" view didn't show starred articles - fixed

4.5.1 - 2020-07-29
  - Bugfix: JavaScript Date parsing on Firefox is broken (due to implementation bug in Firefox) and for example pubDate "Mon, 31 Aug 20 13:00:28 +0200"
      is parsed as Date object Wed Aug 20 2031 14:00:28 GMT+0300. In other words, 2-digit year parsing doesn't work correctly. Created a workaround that
      manually parses those kind of datestamps correctly.

4.5.0 - 2020-07-20
  - Enhancement: Twitter plugin doesn't need the pinned tab anymore. However /home and /explore views are no longer supported

4.4.10 - 2020-07-18
  - Enhancement: Twitter pinned tab cookie refresh window is now kept open for 3 seconds to deal with slower network connections

  - Enhancement: now feeds that have the oldest item first and newest item last in the XML are also parsed properly
  - Enhancement: Twitter plugin can now auto-initialize required cookies by opening a pinned tab for a second even if Twitter has not been accessed after restarting Feedbro

4.4.5 - 2020-07-07
  - Enhancement: init-background now makes feedbrobg a window attribute to prevent it from going out-of-scope

4.4.4 - 2020-07-06
  - Enhancement: added attribute "persistent": true to manifest.json to prevent background page unloading on some browsers

4.4.3 - 2020-07-03
  - Enhancement: Facebook pages of type https://www.facebook.com/groups/12345678987 should be now properly parsed
  - Enhancement: Facebook post layout improvements

4.4.1 - 2020-06-27

  - Feature: LinkedIn hashtag feeds (e.g. https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=purpose) are now supported

  - Enhancement: LinkedIn home feed and group feed entries now contain the author name, title and picture
  - Enhancement: potential memory leak fix: feed tree data is now a copy in Feedbro Reader view to break object linking to the background page
  - Enhancement: small fixes based on ESLint analysis tool (used in addition to JSHint)
  - Enhancement: TagSelector rewritten for better performance - now you must click on the tag icon to activate the tag widget for the feed entry
  - Enhancement: HTML5 canvas elements are now ignored by ClearBody

  - Enhancement: video tags are limited to max 100% (fixes e.g. too wide enclosures)
  - Enhancement: if XML feed has media:content and enclosure with the same URL, only one of them is included in the parsed feed

      Useful e.g. for flickr.com feeds

  - Enhancement: extra portion of an enclosure link is hidden with ellipsis if it's too long	  

4.2.5 - 2020-05-06

      available. Duplicates are removed based on GUIDs.

4.2.4 - 2020-05-06
  - Enhancement: if an article is updated, the original "published" datestamp, (un)read status, tags, star status etc. are preserved
      Unlike in 4.2.2 the article does not appear as new and does not get a new timestamp. This is because most updates are cosmetic minor
      changes like fixing typos and small edits and typically users don't want to be notified about these again. Also preserving original
      published date helps to keep the original publication order of articles.

4.2.3 - 2020-05-05
  - Enhancement: when an article is updated, the following rule actions are NOT executed: desktop notification, play sound, play sound URL, IFTTT

      entry, it will not create a new entry in Feedbro but Feedbro will update the contents and mark the article as unread
  - Enhancement: article meta data updating procedure improved
  - Enhancement: Feedbro Help file now contains a hyperlink for downloading your YouTube subscriptions as OPML
  - Enhancement: CSS color scheme enhancements for all themes and especially sepia theme

  - Enhancement: Spanish locale externalized

4.1.2 - 2020-04-10

4.1.1 - 2020-02-26
  - Feature: added support for the ancient RSS 0.90 still used by e.g. http://rss.slashdot.org/Slashdot/slashdotLinux
  - Enhancement: bookmark import feature is hidden in non-Firefox browsers
  - Feature: added Spanish as one of the built-in languages
  - Feature: new Option in Settings: "Disable HTTP Header listener". Checking this will disable HTTP Header modification which may prevent
      certain websites from showing up in view mode 6 (sites that prevent iframe embedding). In addition, received HTTP Link headers may cause
      memory leaks especially when using ClearBody to load full articles. Checking this option is justified if you are using "On specific sites" setting
      in the WebExtension "Site access" settings and allow Feedbro to access only limited number of domains. When this restriction is on and HTTP Header Listener
      is not disabled, Chrome misleadingly claims that Feedbro "wants access to this site" on all other sites than whitelisted ones because the HTTP Header Listener
      is active. It's recommended to leave this option unchecked and use the default "On all sites" option under "Site access".
      Note! This change introduced two new i18n keys: "options_disableheaderlistener_body", "options_disableheaderlistener_input_title" that need entries
      in locale versions.

  - Feature: Feedbro now finds RSS links on bitchute.com
  - Feature: Feedbro can now convert bitchute.com RSS feeds so that video players are embedded and visible (advanced lazy-loading like with Youtube applied)

  - Bugfix: social media parser fix

3.43.0 - 2019-07-12
  - Feature: SlideShare.net custom search support

  - Enhancement: middle pane scrollbar thumb is now better visible in aqua theme in viewmode 3 and 6
  - Bugfix: added z-index CSS setting div.lazyload as it was causing problems to at least one user on Windows 10

3.42.6 - 2019-06-03
  - Bugfix: feed parsing didn't properly detect network down (398) and reported it internally as feed timeout (399). This may have caused a delay for feed parsing

3.42.5 - 2019-05-31
  - Enhancement: slight CSS fixes (e.g. toolbar, titles section font size)

3.42.4 - 2019-05-24
  - Enhancement: added a few html sanitization safeguards

3.42.3 - 2019-05-18
  - Bugfix: Header adjustment fix

3.42.2 - 2019-05-18
  - Enhancement: Feedbro now automatically removes Link HTTP header from Feedbro related HTTP calls to prevent asset preloading 
      in the background when using ClearBody (that would create memory leaks)
  - Enhancement: ClearBody now disables different types of prefetching when parsing the html page to prevent memory leaks
      See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content
  - Enhancement (MAJOR): ClearBody now renames dynamic content related tags like audio, video, svg, source etc. before parsing the
      html string as a DOM Document. Tags are restored in the parsed fragment. This finally fixes the bizarre memory leaks that happened
      in the background (pending audio/video elements with attached DOM element trees)
  - Enhancement: restored HTTP X-Frame-Options header modification affecting view mode 6 since this wasn't the root cause of memory issues after all
	  
3.42.1 - 2019-05-17
  - Enhancement: remove all script tags from html documents scanned by ClearBody even before parsing the DOM

  - Bugfix: Fixed a memory leak in the new FeedParser (getContent)
  - Bugfix: Fixed an uncatched exception which would occur when the feed entry contains no link tag and no published date tag (interupted parsing)

3.41.7 - 2019-05-06
  - Enhancement: some feeds contain extra whitespace for link tags. Feedbro now trims those values to avoid broken links.

3.41.6 - 2019-05-05
  - Bugfix: after changing from view mode 2 to view mode 1 images wouldn't load because of lazyload attributes set for the images - fixed
  - Enhancement: various CSS improvements to greatly improve rendering in case user has "minimum font size" setting in Firefox on

3.41.5 - 2019-05-04
  - Enhancement: X-Frame-Options HTTP Header modification is now limited to only iframes created by extensions (Feedbro)

  - Feature: new option "Truncate long titles (view mode 2)" - on by default
  - Feature: new theme: Chill - light theme but with less bright colors
  - Bugfix: Help window can no longer open a popup window that is taller than the screen size (this could have happened with resolutions like x * 800)
  - Enhancement: title is now fully expanded when opening items in view mode 2 and truncated again when collapsing the item  

3.41.1 - 2019-05-03
  - Enhancement: restored IntersectionObserver polyfill because apparently many Firefox users use about:config tweaks that disable that API
      For example: https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js
  - Enhancement: slightly smaller fonts in the popup due to requests

3.41.0 - 2019-05-01
  - Feature: new feed parser that should properly support XML namespaces. It's also faster and more memory efficient than the old one.
  - Feature: LinkedIn Job Search is now supported
  - Feature: popup Open Explorer view now shows the full article title in the tooltip
  - Feature: View mode 6 should now work also with sites that use HTTP X-Frame-Options header to block iframe embedding

  - Enhancement: better font stack option selected by default
  - Enhancement: properly styled select boxes in feed finder
  - Enhancement: improved printing layout (extra borders and controls removed)
  - Enhancement: various CSS tweaks and font-family changes

  - Enhancement: improved view mode 2 (headlines) by disabling title wrapping, making font a bit smaller and positioning top star always in the same spot
  - Cleanup: removed IntersectionObserver API polyfill since supported browsers now support the API natively
  - Bugfix: removed unnecessary log event from feed finder
  - Bugfix: printing didn't work properly in Firefox - fixed
  - Tip: if you are on Linux, install Roboto font to get nicer looking UI (e.g. sudo apt-get install fonts-roboto)
  
3.39.3 - 2019-03-24
  - Feature: favicon provider is now configurable (in Options). You can choose between Google and DuckDuckGo. Google is faster but
      it has cache header only for 24 hours which means that every 24 hours Feedbro will re-download each favicon. DuckDuckGo caches
      for one month but it is slower to respond and returns HTTP 404 for domains it can't find -> such favicons are requested every time again.
  - Enhancement: added CSS white-space: pre for <code> html elements
  - Bugfix: notifyEngine related message passing error fixed in Firefox
	  
3.39.2 - 2019-03-18
  - Enhancement: fixed a message passing related harmless error in Chrome console

3.39.0 - 2019-01-19
  - Feature: Advanced Feed Finder in the Reader view (experimental) - use the green + icon to activate
  - Bugfix: IFTTT background thread caused memory issues - removed
  
3.38.2 - 2019-01-16
  - Feature: colored scrollbars in dark & sepia theme in Firefox. You must set about:config option "layout.css.scrollbar-colors.enabled" to true to enable this feature.
  - Bugfix: Feedbro Help had incorrect instructions regarding IFTTT webhook URL. The correct form for the parameter is: https://maker.ifttt.com/trigger/MYEVENT/with/key/AC11cggLDrvAWSZubQk7pn
      Where you need to replace MYEVENT with the actual name of the event you have defined in IFTTT (and replace the key of course with your own key).
  - Bugfix: IFTTT Webhook action handler in a Rule didn't work if there were other actions in the Rule as well. Fixed.
  - Bugfix: Desktop notifications will be now shown in the correct order (first in, first out)
  - Enhancement: IFTTT triggering uses a background thread to fire IFTTT maker channel calls with limited pace to avoid an overflow of calls that could timeout

3.38.1 - 2019-01-04
  - Feature: Feedbro Options page now uses selected theme colors
  - Feature: RTL support for "Open Explorer" added
  - Bugfix: small CSS fixes in the popup (feed discovery)
  - Bugfix: Do you really want to mark ... as read?-confirm dialog checking with Enter was broken. Fixed.
  - Bugfix: fixed subtle pixel shift CSS problem in newspaper view
  - Enhancement: some CSS fixes in the reader view

3.38.0 - 2019-01-03
  - Feature: popup menu now contains "Open Explorer" option which opens a simple feed/folder navigator for browsing unread article titles in feeds. Rules are not applied.
  - Feature: automatic feed scanning in the background can be now completely disabled. See "Disable automatic feed scanning" in Options. Even if this is
      enabled, you can manually trigger feed scanning (right-click the feed or folder or use the blue reload icon in the top left-hand corner).
  - Feature: generated OPML file now has a datestamp (yyyyMMdd-HHmmss) in the filename for easier archiving
  - Feature: when importing OPML you can now skip existing feeds and folders by checking "Skip existing OPML entries" in Options (on by default)
  - Feature: articles can be now marked as read in the popup
  - Feature: links on Youtube article descriptions are now automatically converted to clickable hyperlinks
  - Feature: added "Unselect All" button to Feed Statistics view
  - Enhancement: Feed Reader view can now show a popup if the background engine detects that IndexedDB is broken which indicates that the browser profile is broken
  - Enhancement: favicons are now cached for 90 days instead of 24 hours (speeds up UI loading) - this HTTP response header manipulation doesn't seem to always work though
  - Enhancement: UI cleanup - removed some borders from the UI elements + added a bit of whitespace here and there
  - Enhancement: Find Feeds in Current Tab now works for the new Reddit UI (auto-appends .rss postfix)
  - Enhancement: Find Feeds will now automatically try append /feed to the URL if it doesn't otherwise find any feed links or XML feed source
  - Enhancement: OPML/Rules download in Options page no longer uses the "open a new tab" workaround since Firefox has fixed the anchor download attribute bug
  - Enhancement: ClearBody now drops elements that have aria-hidden="true" attribute
  - Bugfix (MAJOR): ClearBody engine crashed if the link pointed to a large non-HTML source. Now accepts only text/html MIME pages and skips known binary extensions automatically.
      Now ClearBody engine should work well with e.g. Hacker News feed that often contains direct links to binary files such as PDFs.
  - Bugfix (MAJOR): fixed Clearbody engine by first doing tag filtering and then calculating weights - previous implementation weighted elements that were dropped in the end
  - Bugfix: now if Feedbro is open in another browser window "Open Feed Reader" will focus that other browser window first before activating the Feedbro tab
  - Bugfix: Pocket is no longer triggered by combinations like ALT+L, CTRL+L
  - Bugfix: some ATOM feeds have two or more content tags. Feedbro now uses only the first one according to the ATOM specification.
  - Bugfix: fixed various plugins
  - Bugfix: Sort Feeds in Folder was case-sensitive - changed to case-insensitive!
  - Bugfix: linkify now properly converts email addresses to hyperlinks in the feed parser
	  
3.37.9 - 2018-08-01
  - Enhancement: improved guard against chrome.storage.local corruption

3.37.8 - 2018-07-22
  - Bugfix: keybind handler was lost if article title was clicked - fixed

3.37.7 - 2018-06-10
  - Enhancement: some RSS 2.0 feeds define dates incorrectly using Atom tags like <updated> (e.g. Tom's Hardware) - added a
      fallback in RSS 2.0 parsing so that if pubDate tag is not found, Atom date tags are tried in order of published, updated
  - Enhancement: improved performance of CSS selectors
  - Bugfix: prev/next/delete functions didn't work in View Mode 6 (embedded iframe)

3.37.6 - 2018-06-04
  - Bugfix: Vivaldi on Linux has an annoying bug with HTML anchor element download attribute - trying to work around it

3.37.5 - 2018-06-02
  - Bugfix: latestItemDate for a feed is not set to match the datestamp of an item if the datestamp is in the future

3.37.4 - 2018-05-24
  - Bugfix: returned 0 millisecond rule to date stamps

3.37.3 - 2018-05-12
  - Enhancement: additional date parsing fix

3.37.2 - 2018-05-12
  - Bugfix: plugin parsing fix
  - Enhancement: adjusted feed date parsing logic

3.37.1 - 2018-04-23
  - Bugfix: removed unnecessary logging entry
  - Enhancement: removed gradient from feed tree highlight
  - Enhancement: removed delicious from the Send To-menu
  - Bugfix: shortcut 'w' no longer triggers if Ctrl, Shift or Alt is pressed at the same time

3.37.0 - 2018-04-14
  - Feature: now you can click the favicon under the feed article title ("from line") to just show the feed articles.
      Note! Requires that you have enabled Options setting: 'Use favicons in article "from line"'
  - Bugfix: feed date parsing for RFC3339 timestamps was not working for timestamps which had milliseconds - fixed	  

3.36.6 - 2018-03-16
  - Bugfix: plugin parsing fixes

3.36.5 - 2018-02-03
  - Enhancement: added two new font options "OpenDyslexic" (free) and "Dyslexie" (proprietary) for people who suffer from dyslexia
  - Enhancement: CTRL+t (or ALT+t) will no longer trigger adding a tag
  - Enhancement: favicon URL protocol changed to https to avoid unnecessary redirects -> faster loading and caching

3.36.4 - 2018-01-15
  - Bugfix: reverted enhancement made in 3.36.1 (don't send "If-Modified-Since"...) since it broke updates for some feeds.

3.36.3 - 2018-01-11
  - Feature: added an option to set the number of concurrent threads that are used when scanning feeds for new articles.
      Higher number of threads = faster scanning but higher network load.

3.36.2 - 2018-01-11
  - Bugfix: fixed regression issue in view mode 2 - article expansion didn't work when clicking on the top part of the entry

3.36.1 - 2018-01-10
  - Enhancement: don't send "If-Modified-Since" HTTP Request header if the source didn't send Last-Modified header last time. Prioritize
      If-None-Match header over If-Modified-Since header. This should make update scanning more lightweight.
  - Enhancement: added 60 and 90 second feed loading timeout options. 
  - Bugfix: mark-as-read when clicking title in viewmode 2 was temporarily broken due to previous layout changes - fixed
  
3.36.0 - 2018-01-01
  - Bugfix: fixed view mode 6 by adding 'sandbox' attribute to iframe to restrict top navigation manipulation. Also added
      "referrerpolicy" attribute.
  - Enhancement: delete icon and mark read icon in the upper right-hand corner should now stay on the same line and in the
      upper corner even if the article title is a long one (wraps)
  - Enhancement: improved by drag & drop in the feed tree so that it isn't even possible to try to drop a folder inside a folder
      or a folder inside a feed. This will reduce errors when organizing the feed tree.
  - Bugfix: added sl=auto URL parameter to Google translate URLs to ensure correct detection of the article language

3.35.4 - 2017-12-23
  - Enhancement: better Youtube feed detection on Youtube pages that contain "channel" in the URL

3.35.3 - 2017-12-23
  - Bugfix: fixed a bug in internal README.txt build instructions for Firefox

3.35.2 - 2017-12-10
  - Enhancement: additional keyboard shortcut handling fixes

3.35.1 - 2017-12-10
  - Bugfix: fixed regression bug with delete article icon/keyboard shortcut

3.35.0 - 2017-12-09
  - Feature (experimental): you can now select "Feed Proxy" for the feed in feed Properties (right-click the feed in the feed tree). Default is 
      to directly access the feed source URL. You can also select "Feedly" as the proxy which makes Feedbro to send the feed queries through 
      Feedly API (only to fetch articles - it doesn't update last read/unread flags or anything).
      The benefit of this is that Feedly stores the full feed history so you don't miss any items when your computer is turned off. Note however,
      that you need to have large enough "Max entries to save" setting for feeds that post several articles in 24h. Also note that the
      Feedly API "lags behind" so articles appear there with a significant delay (can be several hours). This option is thus only recommended
      for feeds that post very frequently, only keep the latest 20 or so in the XML feed and you don't want to miss any of the articles.
  - Enhancement: the max number of entries to load from a feed source with a single request now depends on the maximum entries to save
      for the feed. So if the feed has e.g. a custom setting of max 300 articles, that's the max number of articles a single request can load
      at once. Previously the max value was 100 (maximum default number of entries to save per feed). You can define a feed specific maximum
      by right-clicking the feed in the feed tree, selecting Properties and adjusting "Maximum entries to save" setting.
  - Feature: some sites may return invalid HTTP Response headers regarding content character encoding. You can now override this by adding URL
      parameter "charset=<chartsetname>" to the feed URL. For example: https://www.example.com/feed?charset=windows-1251 - Note that if there
      are already existing URL parameters, you need to add an ampersand properly like: https://www.example.com/feed?foo=bar&charset=windows-1251
  - Bugfix: keyboard shortcuts should work now properly even if you have "Search for text when you start typing" option enabled in Firefox options
  - Enhancement: parsing fixes
	  
3.34.0 - 2017-11-28
  - Feature: view mode 6. Similar to view mode 3 but it embeds the original article as an iframe to the right panel. Note that many sites
      prevent iframe embedding by using HTTP Response headers so this doesn't work with all feeds and sites. To get more space for the
      embedded article, you can hide the feed tree by pressing 'w' or by clicking the "three lines" icon in the top left-hand corner.
  - Enhancement: removed confirmation dialog from the "Refresh all feeds button"

3.33.0 - 2017-11-24
  - Bugfix: Firefox bookmark importing to Feedbro crashed if one of several bookmarks had href starting with "view-source:". Now Feedbro
      drops such invalid bookmarks when importing.
  - Enhancement: some parsing fixes
  - Feature: in viewmodes 1, 2 and 3 there's now a circle icon in the top right-hand corner of each article. Click it to mark the article
      as read/unread. Mainly relevant when using "mark as read" modes "when bottom is displayed" and "manually". Note that when "mark as read"
      mode is "automatically when title is shown", articles don't show the checkmark or don't show as unread when first loaded. Otherwise
      it would be difficult to determine which articles are new.
  - Bugfix (MAJOR): given settings "show only unread" and "mark read manually" (or bottom article + other viewmode than 1 or 3), the
      same articles were loaded repeatedly.

3.32.4 - 2017-11-21
  - Feature: you can now adjust text line-height in Options. Good value is around 1.45. Value "normal" is the default defined by the font.
  - Feature: added button to refresh all feeds from feed sources (XML) - note that you shouldn't need to do this since Feedbro scans
      for new articles automatically in the background. Note also that this is a heavy operation.

3.32.2 - 2017-11-20
  - Bugfix: Firefox bookmark importing fixes. The HTML file is challenging to parse correctly.

3.32.1 - 2017-11-20
  - Workaround: Firefox has a nasty bug on Linux and Macintosh which makes it impossible to download files properly (namely to export OPML
      and Rules). See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1413460 - as a workaround, Feedbro opens a popup window and displays the
      file to be downloaded. The user must then right-click the popup and choose "Save as". You must allow the extension to show popups for
      this to work.

3.32.0 - 2017-11-19
  - Feature: now you can import Feed subscriptions from exported Firefox bookmarks (HTML file) - see the "Import Firefox Subscriptions"
      button in Options.
  - Enhancement: you can now also click the "Keep unread" text to mark the article read/unread (not just the checkbox)
  - Enhancement: if the OPML/import file does not have a title for the feed, the feed title is automatically taken from the feed XML source
      when the feed is first loaded (auto-replace "Unnamed feed" -> actual feed title)

3.31.5 - 2017-10-28
  - Feature: added Flipboard to sharing options

3.31.4 - 2017-10-26
  - Enhancement: CTRL+d or ALT+d no longer deletes an article. You have to press just 'd'. ALT+d conflicted with activating the address bar.
  - Enhancement: Feed name displayed in the article header is now the name the user has defined for the feed in the feed tree. Not the name
      specified by the feed itself.  

3.31.3 - 2017-10-19
  - Bugfix: at least one clever user managed to drag folders under other folders although Feedbro does not support subfolders. As a result, he
      got incorrect OPML export and odd behaviour. Fixed tree drag & drop so that folders really cannot be moved under other folders.
  - Enhancement: slight tweaks to Sepia theme colors - our new favorite theme now!
  - Bugfix: fromline didn't expand to 100% width on Firefox - fixed  

3.31.2 - 2017-10-18
  - Bugfix: "Mark all as read" button also had the last read pointer bug. Fixed.

3.31.1 - 2017-10-18
  - Bugfix: feed tree folder context menu option "Mark all items as read" didn't update the extension icon total unread count
  - Bugfix: Marking items read also updated the last read pointer of the feed/folder to current time which might have caused missing articles  
  - Enhancement: reduced the margin between articles horizontally

3.31.0 - 2017-10-16
  - Feature: added properties icon to the "Feed Statistics" view which allows you to edit the feed properties. It should also work by right-clicking
      the feed in the feed tree. Note that after saving the feed properties the "Feed Statistics" view isn't automatically updated.
  - Feature: Sepia-like theme (alpha version - subject to change)

3.30.3 - 2017-10-10
  - Bugfix: fixed right-click feed/folder problem with Macintosh

3.30.2 - 2017-10-10
  - Enhancement: restored Options menu item in the popup menu. It's handy in some situations especially on Firefox where you can't get the options
      page by right-clicking the extension icon.

3.30.1 - 2017-10-10
  - Enhancement: since Firefox Private Browsing Mode has too many problems (getBackgroundPage() returns null, IndexedDB doesn't work properly etc)
      Feedbro now properly signals to the user that it is not accessible in Private Browsing Mode when user clicks the extension icon or tries to
      open the Reader view. Hopefully in the future we can make things work also in Private Browsing Mode but currently it's not worth it.

3.30.0 - 2017-10-09
  - Enhancement: view modes 2, 4 and 5 should load now radically faster especially if the feed articles contain a lot of images or iframes.
      Feedbro should also use significantly less network bandwidth when loading these views. The secret is clever attribute based lazy-loading.
  - Enhancement: Options and Help removed from the popup menu since they are available in the Reader toolbar + options can be also accessed by
      right-clicking the extension icon (in Chrome) or in addon/extension list.
  - Enhancement: now when you right-click the article title in view mode 3, the article is opened in a new tab without activating the tab. Hold
      down CTRL to also activate. In other words, the previous functionality is now reversed.
  - Feature: added "Known Issues" document (accessible from Help) to list all the current technical challenges with Firefox and
      instructions how to add Feedbro as ContentHandler in Firefox (cannot be done programmatically yet).
  - Feature: there's now an option (default: off) to show feed favicon in front of the "from line" under the article headline. However, the favicon
      is not visible in view modes 4 and 5 until you expand the article. This is intentional.
  - Bugfix: clicking Delete icon now properly selects the next article and marks it active if the deleted article was active	  

3.29.8 - 2017-10-07
  - Enhancement: fixed notification box by removing "by ..." if article author is an empty string
  - Bugfix (MAJOR): sounds played in Firefox only once due to bug in Firefox HTML5 Audio class implementation (readyState)
  - Bugfix: sound selection dropdown in Rule form in dark mode now has proper background color  

3.29.7 - 2017-10-07
  - Bugfix: some CSS corrections
  - Bugfix: desktop notifications did not work properly on Firefox - Firefox does not show notifications if the API is called more than once
       in rapid succession. Modified so that notifications are queued and shown one by one every second (except when adding a new feed).
  - Bugfix (MAJOR): Rule Engine had a "Dead Object" problem (rule saved from UI, then UI closed -> rule became dead in the background). This messed up
       rule evaluation and Rules mainmenu.  

3.29.6 - 2017-10-05
  - Featured: removed keyboard shortcut for starting Feedbro because it causes problems in Firefox

3.29.5 - 2017-10-03
  - Feature: in viewmode 3 you can now right-click the title in the middle titles view to open the article in a new tab (activates the tab).
       If you hold CTRL down when right-clicking the article, the tab with the article won't be activated automatically.
       Keyboard shortcut 'v' will also open the article in a new tab but without activating the tab.
  - Feature: you can now sort feeds in alphabetical order in a folder by right-clicking the folder in the feed navigator and by selecting
       "Sort feeds in folder"  
  - Enhancement: folder toggles and feed/folder colors might slightly brighter in dark mode
  - Bugfix: Feed tree context menu had invalid z-index CSS parameter name. Fixed.
  - Enhancement: now right-click does nothing in Feed tree context menu (to prevent browser default right-click context menu from appearing)

3.29.4 - 2017-09-29
  - Enhancement: added favicon for the Reader view which is visible if you e.g. drag the reader view URL to your bookmarks bar
  - Enhancement: improved XML parsing "tolerance" by automatically removing (some) invalid characters from malformed XML feeds
  - Enhancement: when mode "Mark items manually as read" is on in view mode 3, article title in titles column is not automatically unbolded.
      It only happens after you mark the article as read (shortcut 'm' or by removing check in checkbox "Keep as unread")  
  - Bugfix: total unread count in the extension is now immediately updated when clicking the article link in the popup list of articles

3.29.3 - 2017-09-28
  - Feature: added Help icon to toolbar (shortcut: shift+?)
  - Enhancement: increased internal ClearBody article scanning timeout to cope with slower sites
  - Enhancement: shortcuts 'm' and 'v' now change the article title color to reflect that the article was marked as read  

3.29.2 - 2017-09-27
  - Feature: Options has a new setting for defining what article header click does in the popup menu. Options: open the article in
      Feedbro or open it on the original website in a separate tab.
  - Feature: Added Donate button (heart, upper left-hand corner) which you can use to securely donate a sum you can decide
      to support Feedbro development.
  - Bugfix: now when clicking the desktop notification of an article to open it in a new tab, the article is also marked as read
  - Enhancement: now when you click "Open Feed Reader" in extension icon popup menu, the popup menu is closed on Firefox automatically
  - Enhancement: borders for resizing feed tree and article list in viewmode 3 are now 2px wide instead of 1px
  - Enhancement: when opening the article in a new tab with shortcut 'v' the article is now automatically marked as read

3.29.1 - 2017-09-15
  - Bugfix: it seems that chrome.storage.local is unreliable/buggy on Chrome (see e.g. issue 490915). chrome.storage.local.get 
      can fail to load data which then caused Feedbro to later save data (feed subscriptions + data) with defaults (empty tree) 
      because the get silently failed. Now if the get call fails, initialized flag isn't turned on and user is notified to 
      reload the browser in order to reload the background process. This is more or less a hack and temporary until we find 
      a better solution.

3.29.0 - 2017-09-14
  - Feature: added Google Translate to "Send To" menu (you can select target language in Options) - shortcut 'g'
  - Feature: Options page now has a button for deleting all Rules. Use with caution!
  - Feature: Rules can be now tested with built-in rule simulator. See Rules menu and "Test Rules" button
  - Feature: added "justify text" to Options
  - Feature: you can now click Feedbro icon in Options page to get back to the Reader view
  - Enhancement: Now when you click a feed in "Feed Statistics" view, selected feed is scrolled into view in the feed tree
  - Enhancement: max width to font select dropdown menu in Options
  - Bugfix: "Send to email" (shortcut 'e') didn't work properly in view mode 3 when using keyboard shortcut - fixed

3.28.1 - 2017-08-27
  - Reupload to Mozilla Add-on store with new version number  
  
3.28.0 - 2017-08-27
  - Bugfix: feed preview link from the popup did double decoding for the URL which broke some URLs with special characters
  - Feature: some parsers added ;)
  - Enhancement: "Send To >" popup themed to dark when dark theme is selected
  - Enhancement: radically reduced background page debug logging and slightly also memory consumption
  - Bugfix: when closing Feedbro reading view, settings are now forcesaved in the background

3.27.2 - 2017-08-20
  - Enhancement: finetuning of the Rules table columns (alignment and size)
  - Enhancement: very slight CSS adjustments to improve font rendering and layout
  - Bugfix: there was an error with internal "Starts with URL" rule condition parameter that overlapped with Title parameter value.
  - Feature: Icon link to Options page is now in the Feedbro toolbar (upper right-hand corner)

3.27.1 - 2017-08-18
  - Bugfix: When clicking delete icon in the popup window, total unread count in the extension icon didn't update. Fixed.

3.27.0 - 2017-08-17
  - Feature: Rule engine improvements - Rules can be now sorted in order by using drag & drop in the Rules view.
      Rule also has a new property called "Fallthrough". If it is true, other rules will be also evaluated even if the
      rule matches (so one article can match multiple rules e.g. one doing highlights, other adding a tag etc). 
      Note that if you have a lot of fallthrough rules, rule evaluation will be slower as there is more
      to do for each article. Unless your rule should apply to a wide range of articles, it should probably not be
      a fallthrough rule.
  - Feature: new columns in Rule list: Type and Fallthrough
  - Bugfix (MAJOR): Feedbro has been using window.localStorage to store settings and feed subscription data. This storage
      can be cleared if user decides to wipe history information, uses browser in incognito mode or has setting
      "clear everything on exit" (in Firefox) enabled. To overcome this, Feedbro now uses chrome.storage.local storage
      which should persist in all cases. manifest.json also includes new "storage" permission which is required.

3.26.5 - 2017-08-15
  - Bugfix: Upgrading to JQuery 3.2.1 had broken feed parsing especially for RSS and RDF feeds containing prefixed tags
      like content:encoded, dc:date and relative link parsing based on xml:base. Should be fixed now.

3.26.4 - 2017-08-15
  - Bugfix: RDF parsing was broken for some reason (at least for craigslist feeds)

3.26.3 - 2017-08-14
  - Feature: MathJax is back (but only for Chrome version) - build system now builds separate versions for Firefox and Chrome

3.26.2 - 2017-08-13
  - Feature: When link icon is clicked in the popup menu article list, the article is automatically marked as read when it is opened in
       a new tab.
  - Feature: When the article title link is clicked and the article is opened in a new tab, the article is automatically marked as read.
       Note! You can hold Ctrl-key to avoid switching into the new tab.
  - Feature: Added delete icon to list of articles in the popup menu short list.
  - Enhancement: Delete link at the end of the article now has a trashbin icon as well
  - Enhancement: Removed FriendFeed and Readability from sharing options as these services are no longer available

3.26.1 - 2017-08-03
  - Enhancement: Upgraded to JQuery 3.2.1
  - Feature: Added "Article URL" as an option for Rule conditions. This is handy e.g. for domain specific blocking or highlights.
  - Feature: Support for MathJax has been removed (sorry!) to comply with tight Firefox add-on security policies
  - Enhancement: modifications to alertify.js code to get around Firefox add-on review warnings and to make it safer

3.25.3 - 2017-07-20
  - Bugfix: now if any of the matched Rule Actions for an article contains action "Delete article" or "Hide article", none of the other
      possibly matched actions will be performed. In other words if one rule matched the article with e.g. action "Hide" and another rule
      matched with action "Desktop notification", the desktop notification will NOT be shown because the "Hide" action eliminates it.

3.25.2 - 2017-07-08
  - Bugfix: MathJax had changed CDN and was not working. manifest.json updated to fix it.
  - Bugfix: Atom feeds that had a summary tag, no Atom content tag and media:content tag didn't display corrent content. Fixed.

3.25.0 - 2017-06-22
  - Feature: Added Shift + d shortcut to delete all articles in currently loaded view
  - Bugfix: scrolling in feed tree when using drag & drop outside the visible tree area should work now

3.24.0 - 2017-05-15
  - Feature: Export/Import Rules in Options
  - Feature: OPML Export/Import now includes entryContent, maxItems and scanDelay attributes

3.23.4 - 2017-04-28
  - Bugfix: due to recent bug in Chrome - Feed/Folder select list on rule form now has an additional CSS setting to ensure 
      minimal height.

3.23.3 - 2017-04-28
  - Bugfix: something has changed in IndexedDB implementation of Chrome which caused database connection to drop and it was not
      automatically restored which stopped updates and saves. Now Feedbro automatically reconnects if the connection is down.
  - Bugfix: reader.html had invalid </html> tag
  - Bugfix: options.html had missing <body> tag

3.23.2 - 2017-04-21
  - Bugfix: Native Intersection Observer API implementation restored after figuring out how to fix it after Chrome 58.x API change.

3.23.1 - 2017-04-20
  - Workaround: Chrome 58.x Intersection Observer API had an unexpected API change which causes all articles to be observed as visible and thus
       all articles in selected folder are immediately marked as read although they aren't all visible yet. To get around this, Feedbro
       temporarily uses Intersection Observer API polyfill to override the native implementation. After the native implementation gets fixed,
       it will be enabled again.

3.23.0 - 2017-04-01
  - Improvement: Feedbro should be now Firefox compatible (primary platform is still Chrome and FF experience is secondary,
       not guaranteed and not officially supported)
  - Bugfix: fixed Youtube Atom feed parsing problem related to yt:videoId tag (problem occurred only in Firefox)
  - Improvement: minor CSS tweaks mainly for compatibility  

3.22.3 - 2017-03-23
  - Improvement: removed some unnecessary console logging messages
  - Bugfix: maxEntries per feed load was temporarily broken due to latest refactoring
  - Bugfix: Last-Modified and ETag headers were broken due to latest refactoring

3.22.2 - 2017-03-22
  - Bugfix: in some scenarios ClearBody engine outputted "undefined" as the feed entry content when the full article scan was unsuccessful
      due to recent changes. Fixed.

3.22.1 - 2017-03-22
  - Bugfix: some Feedbro users are using older Chrome browsers (Major version below 51) which do not have Intersection Observer API
      available. Due to this, Feedbro now comes with a polyfill to support older browsers. See
      https://github.com/WICG/IntersectionObserver/tree/gh-pages/polyfill	  

3.22.0 - 2017-03-21
  - Improvement: memory usage improved by converting frequently instantiated classes to use JS prototype pattern.
  - Improvement: performance and memory usage improved by removing jquery.inview-plugin which is replaced by using Intersection Observer API
  - Improvement: removed jquery.min.map to reduce size
  - Improvement: background.html Console no longer prints a log message every time it scans a feed
  - Improvement: various small tweaks to improve memory usage and speed
  - Bugfix: fixed a memory leak in ClearBody engine
  - Bugfix: preview icon (eye) did not work properly in the "Find Feeds in Current Tab" popup if the feed URL contained characters ? or &. Fixed.
  - Bugfix: fixed a potential memory leak in Opera view mode
  - Improvement: Feedbro now finds feeds also on Youtube pages with URL like https://www.youtube.com/channel/<id> when 
      using "Find Feeds in Current Tab". Feedbro also finds feeds on standard Youtube home pages like: https://www.youtube.com/user/JenniferLopezVEVO

3.21.3 - 2017-03-01
  - Bugfix: after marking All feed entries in All feeds as read, the unread counter in the extension icon didn't update. Fixed.

3.21.2 - 2017-02-26
  - Bugfix: fully restored previous max search count setting

3.21.1 - 2017-02-26
  - Bugfix (MAJOR): feed item search was accidentally limited to return only 100 hits which broke feeds that were defined to
      store more than 100 items.

3.21.0 - 2017-02-12
  - Feature (MAJOR): new Rule option: "Add Points" and new article sort method: "Sort by points". With rules you can now
      add "points" to feed entries when they arrive. "Sort by points" view then shows the feed entries with the most points first.
      If two entries have equal points (e.g. 0), then the newer entry will be shown first. Note that the point value can be also
      negative. With this feature you can "lift up" or "bury" articles that meet certain criteria. For example you could assign
      -1000 points to all articles that arrive into feeds in certain folder. That allows you to keep them as last items
      in the "All Items" view. Similarly you can add points to articles that contain e.g. certain keywords so that they rise up
      on your lists. If you are e.g. monitoring certain stocks or events, this can be very useful.
  - Bugfix: magnet-links are now properly processed when used as feed entry links
  - Bugfix (MAJOR): Sort by oldest article sorting was totally broken - fixed
  - Improvement: shift+right-arrow/left-arrow now works also in view mode 3 (three column view)
  - Improvement: unified look and feel of "Add Feed"-dialog in dark mode

3.20.0 - 2017-02-04
  - Feature: "add tag" input field can be now activated with shortcut 't'
  - Improvement: when adding a tag, pressing enter or Add Tag will automatically add the tag and close the dialog since in 99%
      of the cases you just want to add one tag.
  - Feature: now you can configure "tag shortcuts" in Options that allow you to add a tag to a feed article with keyboard shortcuts
      like ALT+1, ALT+2, ALT+3, ALT+4, ALT+5

3.19.3 - 2017-01-29
  - Feature: in viewmode 3 (three panels) it is now possible to switch on/off favicons in the titles list. On by default.
  - Improvement: default font stack changed to Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif to avoid ugly font rendering on some Asian locales.

3.19.2 - 2017-01-28
  - Improvement: now it's not possible to save Rules with actions that are not triggered in the selected When-context
  - Improvement: added short instructions how to use IFTTT to the Help page

3.19.1 - 2016-10-31
  - Bugfix: Feed preview mode fixed.

3.19.0 - 2016-10-31
  - Feature: "Refresh article list when opening Reader view" option (false by default) lets you define whether Feedbro should
      automatically reload the current list of articles when reading view is opened.
  - Improvement: Rule action with regexp words highlighting runs faster now.
  - Bugfix: CSS settings in "Add Feed" dialog got overridden by feed entries that used <style> tags in Preview mode. Fixed.

3.18.3 - 2016-10-18
  - Bugfix: Rule condition "matches all words" was horribly broken. Fixed.

3.18.2 - 2016-10-15
  - Improvement: word boundaries for Rule condition "contains any words that start with" changed from \b to more 
      unicode friendly version.
  - Improvement: added note text to Options page that you must define a rule in order to get notifications or sounds.

3.18.1 - 2016-10-14
  - Feature: added "contains any words that start with" condition to Rule conditions. This allows you to match
      Rules based on word prefixes. E.g. with values "leader,bus" the rule would match whenever the article
      contains any word that begins with either leader or bus - for example 'leadership' or 'business'. However
      the rule would not match e.g. word 'nimbus'
  - Bugfix: in view mode '3' the date header in the article list was incorrectly showing "last month" for certain older posts. Fixed.

3.18.0 - 2016-10-13
  - Feature: added "Preview" button to "Add Feed"-dialog so that it is easier to try which "Feed entry content" setting works
      best for the feed being added.
  - Feature: "Find Feeds in Current Tab" popup now has preview icon links for opening the feed in Feedbro before subscribing
      Preview lets you inspect the feed contents & quality and adjust settings before actually subscribing.
  - Feature: more settings to "Mark Read" function: never, always, only for "All Items" view
  - Feature: added a simple survey that is trigged if user decides to uninstall
  - Improvement: when saving feeds with the "Add Feed"-dialog the dialog remembers the previously used save folder setting per session
  - Bugfix: Ctrl+L no longer opens Pocket sharing window. Lower-case L keyboard shortcut ('l') still opens it.

3.17.3 - 2016-10-01
  - Improvement: added more font family options (especially for Chinese and Japanese)

3.17.2 - 2016-09-12
  - Bugfix: feed titles that contained tags messed up the popup article heading list

3.17.1 - 2016-09-12
  - Improvement: MathJax detection performance improved slightly

3.17.0 - 2016-09-11
  - Feature: MathJax support - when enabled, automatically renders feed entries containing LaTeX or TeX markup
      using MathJax rendering library to display beautiful mathematical formulas. Off by default, enable in Options.
  - Improvement: hide extra divider in the popup when feed database is empty
  - Bugfix: clicking Find Feeds in Current Tab twice or more does not duplicate the list of discovered feeds anymore

3.16.0 - 2016-09-07
  - Feature: Feedbro can now show 10 latest unread & unstarred articles when you click the Feedbro icon in the popup
      This feature can be turned off in Options. See "Show latest articles in popup".
  - Improvement: Find Feeds in Current Tab - slight html/css improvements and fixes
  - Improvement: Feed parsing improved - some feeds with incorrectly placed xml declaration should get parsed now

3.15.2 - 2016-09-05
  - Improvement: scrollbar thumb styling improved by adding a wider border

3.15.1 - 2016-09-04
  - Bugfix: Options page wasn't scrollable if it didn't fit in the window - fixed

3.15.0 - 2016-09-04
  - Improvement: now when you click the desktop notification, Feedbro opens the article directly in Feedbro in 
      viewmode 1 (full article view) regardless of the selected actual viewmode OR the original article is opened in
      a new tab (html page). See Feedbro Options page to set the preference "Article desktop notification click".
      Default behaviour is to open the article in Feedbro.

3.14.0 - 2016-09-03
  - Improvement: scrollbars now have arrows for scrolling
  - Improvement: improved colors for the Rule form in dark theme
  - Bugfix: in some situations dark theme might have ended up having light colored scrollbar instead of the darker one
  - Bugfix: changed OPML export file extension to .opml according to the specification
  - Bugfix: OPML import now scans feeds also from nested folders (outline-elements) (sub-folder(s) inside main folder)

3.13.2 - 2016-08-21
  - Improvement: Layout improvements to Rules, Tags, Feed Statistics views. CSS tweaks.
  - Improvement: Rule dialog now re-centers the dialog when new conditions or actions are added.

3.13.1 - 2016-08-18
  - Feature: added VK.com to sharing options
  - Bugfix: Atom feeds entries that contained e.g. title and media:title tag caused Feedbro to include both as title. Fixed.

3.13.0 - 2016-08-15
  - Feature: Feedbro now parses RSS feeds provided by Youtube so that video thumbnail and description are visible in
      the article bodies. Feedbro embeds the video and can scale the video size automatically based on the viewport size. 
      To subscribe to a Youtube feed, navigate to Youtube channel page (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/user/mhyatt18) 
      and use "Find Feeds in Current Tab".

3.12.4 - 2016-08-13
  - Fix: reverted entry background color change in the dark theme

3.12.3 - 2016-08-13
  - Bugfix: Feed Statistics page showed incorrect "Last Updated" value for feeds that had pinned old post as the first entry
      in the xml feed and feed update process didn't find any new articles since the last scan. Fixed.
  - Improvement: slight CSS tuning to improve visual appearance.

3.12.2 - 2016-08-03
  - Bugfix: Feedbro used to stop feed parsing when it found the first article that was too old. This broke some feeds that
      have pinned old entries as the first item in the feed XML. Fixed.
  - Bugfix: emojis in Tweets are now in normal size (when using e.g. twitrss.me service)
  - Bugfix: sharing via email didn't work due to Chrome bug (mailto-protocol does not trigger in popups anymore) - changed implementation 
      to fix it. Fixed.

3.12.1 - 2016-05-27
  - Bugfix: Chrome 51 update caused a bug in the Opera View article list (dates partially hidden) - fixed

3.12.0 - 2016-05-06
  - Improvement: Feed loading now uses native XMLHttpRequest timeout attribute instead of custom timer
  - Improvement: ClearBody engine ("Readability") now uses the Settings value for "Feed loading timeout" as timeout value
      for loading articles. If you find feed entries that did not properly load as full text article despite your
      feed setting "Get full article body" try increasing the value in "Feed loading timeout" setting.
  - Twitter and Instagram support removed
	  
3.11.0 - 2016-05-02
  - Improvement: added some tooltips to hint the user that in view modes 2, 4 and 5 the article area can be clicked to open
      the article within Feedbro
  - Bugfix: on Linux Chrome if the OPML file being imported contained invalid markup, the user didn't get a warning popup - fixed	  

3.10.0 - 2016-04-26
  - Improvement: some CSS tweaks to improve visual appearance

3.9.3 - 2016-04-04
  - Bugfix: fixed Feedbro startup problem when feedManager was accessed before database connection was open (rare timing problem)

3.9.2 - 2016-04-03
  - Bugfix (Major): fixed a nasty layout bug that occurred only on Linux Chrome - clicking a feed in the feed navigator scrolled the
      feed tree to the top. This did not occur on Windows. Probably introduced by some of the latest Chrome builds.

3.9.1 - 2016-03-26
  - Bugfix: "Find feeds in Current Tab" for Instagram pages was broken - fixed

3.9.0 - 2016-03-26
  - Bugfix (Major): Rules with Regexp conditions did not work after saving, rule matching and browser restart - fixed
  - Feature: you can now right-click a folder and select "Updated Feeds in Folder" which reloads all feeds in that folder from
      the sources (actual feeds). Note that Feedbro does update all feeds automatically and uses an intelligent algorithm to do
      this at scheduled intervals according to your settings so usually there should be no need to call this action manually.
  - Improvement: ugly blue default border around images in feed articles is removed with CSS
  - Improvement: UI made slightly cleaner by removing borders from toolbar buttons and select lists

3.8.5 - 2016-03-12
  - Improvement: link color in Dark theme made lighter

3.8.4 - 2016-03-10
  - Improvement: in Opera-view mode (3) up and down arrows no longer move between articles because that would
      prevent scrolling the actual article with arrow keys. Use 'n' and 'p' to move up and down in the article list
      if you want to use keys to navigate the article list.

3.8.3 - 2016-03-09
  - Improvement: some feeds use weird hybrid of RSS 2.0 and Atom markup. In such cases items may have entry items with
      atom link tag instead of RSS link tag. Feedbro now scans both cases.
  - Improvement: toggle buttons have slightly brighter color in Dark mode to make it easier to see which toggles are on.
  - Bugfix: OPML export failed in rare cases when the feed xmlUrl was undefined

3.8.2 - 2016-02-13
  - Improvement: links are underlined and shown with better color in Dark theme
  - Improvement: favicon loading should be now slightly more efficient
  - Improvement: some other slight CSS adjustments
  - Feature: added a couple of new fonts to font family options in Settings

3.8.1 - 2016-02-12
  - Bugfix: if feed html url contained a port number, favicon cache didn't return a proper image

3.8.0 - 2016-02-11
  - Feature: Feedbro now supports favicons for feeds in the feed navigator. On by default, change in Settings.

3.7.4 - 2016-02-04
  - Bugfix: refixed unread flag bug in "Mark artile as read" "Manually" mode.

3.7.3 - 2016-02-04
  - Bugfix: reverted fix in 3.7.2 (needs a different approach)

3.7.2 - 2016-02-03
  - Bugfix: fixed unread flag bug in "Mark artile as read" "Manually" mode.

3.7.1 - 2016-01-31
  - Bugfix: some CSS adjustments

3.7.0 - 2016-01-31
  - Feature: you can now change the article body font size in settings
  - Feature: you can now change the font family in settings
  - Improvement: front page big Feedbro icon now opens "All Items" view (which you can also set as default in Settings)
  - Improvement: added a tooltip in list views ("Click to Open")
  - Improvement: slight adjustments to the ClearBody engine settings

3.6.3 - 2015-12-26
  - Bugfix: unicode encoded html character decoding added already to feed parsing state to allow Rules with trigger "New article arrives"
      to also work properly.

3.6.2 - 2015-12-21
  - Bugfix: feed entries that had a title containing html tags were shown as html tags - now tags are stripped from title elements
      Fixes e.g. JIRA feeds.
  - Bugfix: if feed content contained html character entities like &#1473; and the Rule condition contained the same characters
      in unicode, there was no match. Same thing for common entities like &auml; and ä. Now Feedbro decodes html characters and
      entities so that you can define rule conditions using unicode and they actually match the text as you see it.	  

3.6.1 - 2015-12-18
  - Feature: Feed statistics main view now shows the feed scanning delay
  - Bugfix: added > and < characters to Rule word boundary test
  - Improvement: scrollbars are a bit darker in the Dark theme

3.6.0 - 2015-12-11
  - Feature: added some new keyboard shortcuts. See Feedbro Help-page.

3.5.3 - 2015-12-09
  - Bugfix: Chrome 47 update somehow broke the flex layout, fixed div#core width with a temporary patch

3.5.2 - 2015-12-08
  - Bugfix: embedded Twitter post image links fixed
  - Facebook has removed their RSS support so Feedbro does not currently support reading Facebook pages

3.5.1 - 2015-11-29
  - Bugfix: embedded Twitter post image links fixed
  - Bugfix: Rule condition "contains all words", "contains any of the words", "doesn't contain words" behaviour changed so that
      it does not use built-in word boundary (\b) before and after the defined word but rather a custom regular expression that
      matches whitespace and common delimiters. This is because the native JavaScript RegExp class does not support
      word boundaries for Unicode strings (for example in Russian). For languages which may have separate words without whitespace
      or delimiters in between should be scanned with condition "matches regexp" for better flexibility.

3.5.0 - 2015-11-01
  - Feature: keyboard shortcut 'l' now saves the currently active article (blue border) directly to Pocket without any
      popups. This also means that the article won't get any tags but it's a very fast way to save many articles for
      reading later.

3.4.2 - 2015-10-27
  - Bugfix: Don't load feed entries that are date stamped into the future. This caused duplicate entries especially
      if the computer clock was at the wrong time.

3.4.1 - 2015-10-22
  - Bugfix: If an Atom entry contained only the summary-tag and it didn't have the content wrapped in div -> error. Fixed.

3.4.0 - 2015-09-27
  - Feature: Feedbro now partially supports OpenSocial 2.0 XML feeds and can render them as HTML.
      See https://opensocial-resources.googlecode.com/svn/spec/2.0/Social-Data.xml

3.3.1 - 2015-09-12
  - Bugfix: Feedbro was unable to parse certain date stamps such as Thu, 06 Aug 2015 06:40:39 EEST because Javascript
      Date object did not properly identify the timezone abbreviation. Fixed.
  - Bugfix: if feed contained articles that were dated far in the future (like year 2105), it messed up last read pointer
      logic. Now Feedbro checks that article date is before current_time before it is considered when updating last read pointers.

3.3.0 - 2015-08-04
  - Feature: Feedbro Rule Engine now supports IFTTT.com (If This Then That) Maker Channel which allows the user to
      trigger various other Internet services (e.g. automatically post the article link to del.icio.us
      if rule matches). See https://maker.ifttt.com - Feedbro uses HTTP POST with JSON body so that 
      {"value1": feedArticle.link, "value2": feedArticle.title, "value3": feedArticle.author}. When specifying a rule,
      choose "IFTTT Maker Channel HTTP POST" as an action and put the maker URL to the input field. For example:
      https://maker.ifttt.com/trigger/submit_delicious/with/key/RS3FdAr9fSJDKeEW - You need to configure the Maker Channel
      with your IFTTT user account which also gives you the authentication string (the last part of the URL).
  - Improvement: slight adjustments to colors in light and dark theme based on feedback - e.g. new article titles are now
      shown with blue color instead of black in the light theme.
	
3.2.4 - 2015-07-27
  - Improvement: improved readability of the dark theme by adjusting colors slightly

3.2.3 - 2015-07-25
  - Bugfix: Chrome 44 update broke the flex layout (Chrome issue 506893) - fixed with a CSS setting

3.2.2 - 2015-06-11
  - Bugfix: if htmlUrl of the feed contained double quotes, Feedbro generated an OPML file with broken markup. Fixed.

3.2.1 - 2015-06-10
  - Bugfix: Instagram feed parsing fixed.

3.2.0 - 2015-06-09
  - Improvement: Feed reader now understands HTML entities like &auml; and is able to parse feeds that use those entities even if 
    they are not escaped with CDATA. 

3.1.5 - 2015-06-04
  - Bugfix: Twitter feed parsing was broken. Fixed.

3.1.4 - 2015-05-30
  - Improvement: text content after the main image in "full feed content" is now displayed on a separate line
  - Improvement: date of atom feed entries is now determined primarily based on published-tag - not updated tag like it used to be
  
3.1.3 - 2015-05-25
  - Bugfix: another layout bugfix for the navigator main menu options caused by the new Chrome 43.x update

3.1.2 - 2015-05-22
  - Bugfix: fixed a bug that was caused by changes in flex-row CSS layout in Google Chrome update 43.x - toolbar height shrinking problem

3.1.1 - 2015-02-26
  - Bugfix: some servers could not correctly interpret the default If-Modified-Since header sent by Feedbro. Datestamp changed to more
    "compatible" date.

3.1.0 - 2015-01-19
  - Feature: Options now provides a selection to what happens when you click the Feedbro extension icon in the browser toolbar.
      Default behaviour is to open the popup menu which allows you to either open the feed reader or scan the tab for new feeds.
      Another option is to open the feed reader directly without the popup. This speeds up loading the feed reader view.
      Note that you can right-click the Feedbro extension icon to access Options-menu to change this setting at any time.			 

3.0.0 - 2015-01-07
  - Feature: full text support for feeds!  Feedbro can now make feeds with partial content display the full article! Right-click the feed
      in the feed navigator and select "Get full article body" or "Get full article body with main image" (adds image defined by meta tag og:image to
      the beginning of the article). This will cause Feedbro to separately fetch each article defined by the feed, parse the body content and 
      embed it to the feed automatically. 
	
      Note that this causes a HTTP GET request for each article and is somewhat slower than just accepting the feed content as it is. You can also 
      define how to handle the feed content when adding a new feed with the +RSS icon (top left-hand corner).
	
      NOTE! Only consider using this option if the feed provides only a fraction of the actual article. Many feeds nowadays already provide the full content
      and in such cases you should select option "As is - defined by the feed" for the "Feed entry content" setting. Also note that if you have this setting
      on for all your feeds, scanning of new articles takes much longer than with normal feed contents.

2.10.0 - 2014-12-29
  - Feature: Aqua theme
  - Feature: "mark as read" has now three options in the Options configuration page: 
      1. mark read automatically when title or end of the article body is seen (default behaviour)
      2. mark read automatically when end of the article body is seen (articles are no longer automatically marked as read in headlines/magazine/newspaper mode)
      3. mark read manually (use "Keep unread" checkbox, m keyboard shortcut, shift+a or Mark Read icon button)

  - Bugfix: RuleEngine - when a rule had multiple feeds or folders selected, rule did not trigger - fixed
  - Bugfix: "Find Feeds in Current Tab" now scans up to 100 link tags (used to be 20 -> Feedbro didn't always find the feed link tag)

  - Improvement: "Find Feeds in Current Tab" discovery mode now notices if you are already subscribing to the feed you're trying to add

  - Improvement: notification system now detects if chrome.notifications module is available or not
  - Improvement: now when a feed is added with add feed dialog or autodiscovery, it is immediately scanned for articles instead of waiting for unreadscan event

2.5.6 - 2014-05-06
  - Improvement: Feedbro will try to load all feeds which failed previously due to a network error (connection down or invalid domain) after 5 minutes
